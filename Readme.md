***Pokémon Legends: Arceus*** is a _2022_ action role-playing game developed by _Game Freak_ and published by _Nintendo_ and _The Pokémon Company_ for the Nintendo Switch. It is part of the eighth generation of the Pokémon video game series and serves as a prequel to __Pokémon Diamond and Pearl__ _(2006)_. The game was first announced as part of the Pokémon 25th Anniversary event in February 2021, and was released worldwide on January 28, 2022.

The game follows the protagonist, sent back through time, as they travel through the ***Hisui*** region based on the island of Hokkaido during early Japanese colonization.
***Pokémon Legends: Arceus*** is an action role-playing game that preserves the core gameplay of past entries in the mainline series. The player is able to roam freely across the game map, divided into five large areas of individual biomes. Each time the player enters such areas, they spawn in a camp, and can fast travel to other camps in the same area. Outside of traversing the landscape on foot, the player can unlock rideable Pokémon which can travel faster, swim across bodies of water, climb cliffs, or fly. In each area, Pokémon wander the landscape, being found in certain habitats and will interact with both the player and their environments. Some will actively avoid the player while others act aggressively, and some exhibit other specific behaviors. A number of _"Alpha"_ Pokémon – larger, more powerful versions of the Pokémon – can also be found in the areas.
Unlike in previous titles, the player character themselves can be attacked and harmed by wild Pokémon. If enough damage is taken, they will fall unconscious and reappear at the base camp. Players can capture wild Pokémon in the overworld without engaging in battle, though some must still be battled before being caught. Battles can be initiated by releasing captured Pokémon near a wild Pokémon. While the turn-based battle system of the prior titles is retained in the game, an additional feature is added which allows players to trade attack damage for more turns and vice versa. Outside standard battles, the game also introduces special boss battles where the player character has to dodge and attack powerful Pokémon, regular turn-based battles being included during the fights as opportunities to stun the bosses.
